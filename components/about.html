            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I’m a software engineer in Los Angeles. I build UIs, fix bugs when needed, and learn new tools fast. I thrive on turning strong ideas into working features that people actually use.</p>

            <p>I’ve led ultramarathon relay teams—mostly to keep us stocked with snacks and avoid getting lost—and I work best with smart, grounded teammates who know how to laugh.</p>

            <p>Outside of work, I run, ski, and dance to techno. I believe the best projects start with good conversations and end with things people care about.</p>
