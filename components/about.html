            <p>Hi, I'm a software engineer in LA who somehow convinced people to pay me to write code. I make websites and apps that occasionally work as intendedâ€”though my track record is admittedly mixed.</p>

            <p>My background is basically academic ADHD: computational biology, data science, web development, and whatever else seemed interesting at the time. I've been known to organize ultramarathon relays, which is really just an elaborate way to make running even more chaotic than it already is.</p>

            <p>When I'm not staring at screens and questioning my life choices, you'll find me running trails (badly), skiing mountains (dangerously), or dancing to techno (embarrassingly). I'm pretty sure I peaked in high school, but we're all just pretending that's not true.</p>
