            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m a software engineer in Los Angeles working in ad tech. I spend most of my time writing code, fixing things that behave differently in production than they did in my head, and learning new ways to be patient.</p>

            <p>My academic background is in computational chemistry, high-performance computing, and data science. Web development came later, mostly on the job, through a steady cycle of building things, breaking them, and eventually understanding them well enough to stop doing that.</p>

            <p>Outside of work, I organize ultramarathon relays. This is nominally about running, but in practice it’s logistics, recruiting, van rentals, food planning, and keeping a group of tired people moving in roughly the same direction. I also spend a lot of time outdoors running trails, skiing when there’s snow, and listening to techno whenever it fits.</p>

            <p>I’m drawn to projects that require some planning, tolerate a little chaos, and are more enjoyable once you’re already committed.</p>
