            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm a software engineer based in Los Angeles, focused on crafting intuitive interfaces and robust systems. I specialize in transforming complex problems into elegant solutions that people actually want to use.</p>

            <p>My background spans computational biology, data science, and full-stack development. I've led teams through challenging projectsâ€”often involving ultramarathon relay logistics and ensuring we stay well-fueled and on course.</p>

            <p>When I'm not coding, you'll find me running trails, skiing mountains, or dancing to techno. I believe the best work emerges from thoughtful collaboration and ends with solutions that matter.</p>
