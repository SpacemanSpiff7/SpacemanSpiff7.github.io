            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm a developer and researcher based in Los Angeles, working at the intersection of computational biology and software engineering. My work focuses on creating tools that make complex data analysis more accessible and efficient.</p>
            
            <p>With experience in bioinformatics, command-line utilities, and web applications, I enjoy building solutions that solve real-world problems. Whether it's processing genomic data, automating workflows, or creating user-friendly interfaces, I'm passionate about crafting tools that work reliably and elegantly.</p>
            
            <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or diving into the latest research in computational methods and AI applications.</p>
